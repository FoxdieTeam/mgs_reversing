Key features
------------

- No dependency but only Python is required.  Prebuilt ``fzf`` binary for
  each platform is bundled into wheels.  Everything is ready by
  ``pip install iterfzf``.  (Note that not wheels of all supported platforms
  are uploaded to PyPI as they don't allow minor platforms e.g. FreeBSD.
  The complete wheels can be found from the `GitHub releases`__.)
- Consumes an iterable rather than a list.  It makes UX way better when the
  input data is long but *streamed* from low latency network.
  It can begin to display items immediately after only *part* of items are
  ready, and *before* the complete items are ready.
- Supports Python 3.8 or higher.

.. _api reference:

``iterfzf.iterfzf(iterable, *, **options)``
-------------------------------------------

Consumes the given ``iterable`` of strings, and displays them using ``fzf``.
If a user chooses something it immediately returns the chosen things. If the
user cancels the selection, the `KeywordInterrupt` exception will be raised.

The following is the full list of parameters.  Pass them as
**keyword arguments** except for ``iterable`` which comes first:

``iterable`` (required)
   The only required parameter.  Every element which this ``iterable`` yields
   is displayed immediately after each one is produced.  In other words,
   the passed ``iterable`` is lazily consumed.

   It can be an iterable of byte strings (e.g. ``[b'foo', b'bar']``) or of
   Unicode strings (e.g. ``[u'foo', u'bar']``), but must not be
   mixed (e.g. ``[u'foo', b'bar']``).  If they are byte strings the function
   returns bytes.  If they are Unicode strings it returns Unicode strings.
   See also the ``encoding`` parameter.

Versioning scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that ``iterfzf`` does *not* follow `Semantic Versioning`_.  The version
consists of its own major and minor number followed by the version of bundled
``fzf``.  For example, 1.2.3.4.5 means that ``iterfzf``'s own major version
is 1, and its own minor version is 2, plus the version of ``fzf`` it bundles
is 3.4.5.
