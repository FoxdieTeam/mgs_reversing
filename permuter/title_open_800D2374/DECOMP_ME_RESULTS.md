| Metric | Initial | Local Permuter | decomp.me |
|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Score | 4020 | 1655 | 825 |
| Improvement | - | 59% | 50% further |

## üöÄ BREAKTHROUGH: Phase 1+2 Optimization Results

**Date**: 2025-10-19 (continued session)
**Critical Discovery**: The local permuter's optimization was **WRONG** for the target!

### The Hypothesis
Previous analysis identified that the permuter's `i = work->f24AC` optimization (found at iteration 26) was creating 3 extra instructions not present in the target assembly. Hypothesis: removing this optimization would improve matching.

### Changes Applied

**Phase 1: Remove Permuter Optimization**
```c
// BEFORE (score 825 @ 86.02%):
i = work->f24AC;              // Extra variable
if (work->f24EC != 0)
{
    switch (i) { ... }         // Switch on local variable

// AFTER (Phase 1):
if (work->f24EC != 0)
{
    switch (work->f24AC) { ... }  // Direct memory access
```

**Phase 2: Fix Struct Field Type**
```c
// BEFORE:
int      f24B4;                           // Wrong type
return (OpenWork *) work->f24B4;          // Required cast

// AFTER (Phase 2):
struct _OpenWork *f24B4;                  // Correct pointer type
return work->f24B4;                       // No cast needed
```

### Results

| Metric | Before Phase 1+2 | After Phase 1+2 | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Score** | 825 | **510** | **-315 (-38%)** |
| **Matching** | 86.02% | **91.36%** | **+5.34%** |

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Hypothesis **CONFIRMED** - removing permuter optimization dramatically improved score
- ‚úÖ The 3 deleted instructions (lines 0x60, 0x64, 0x68) are now closer to matching
- ‚úÖ Struct pointer type fix eliminated unnecessary cast operations
- ‚úÖ We're now **91.36% matched** - very close to perfect!

### Screenshot Evidence
![Phase 1+2 Success](/.playwright-mcp/phase1_success_510_91percent.png)
- decomp.me scratch: https://decomp.me/scratch/F1WN5
- Compiler: gcc 2.8.1 + aspsx 2.79 (PSYQ 4.4)
- Flags: `-O2 -Wall -G8`
- Code: Phase 1+2 optimized version

### Key Insight: When Permuter Optimizations Fail

This case demonstrates an important lesson: **local permuter optimizations can be counterproductive for real target matching**.

**Why this happened**:
1. Local permuter optimized for minimizing Levenshtein distance against a reference
2. The `i = work->f24AC` optimization improved *local* score (1655)
3. But the *real target* never had this optimization - it uses direct memory access
4. Result: The optimization created extra instructions not in target assembly

**Lesson learned**: Always validate permuter results against the actual target, not just local score improvements.

## üîç Analysis of Remaining Differences (510 @ 91.36%)

### Assembly Diff Summary
The decomp.me diff shows:

**Register Differences** (marked with 'r'):
- Line 0x48: Uses `a0` in target vs `v0` in current
- Lines in switch statement: Uses `v1` in target vs `s0` in current

**Instruction Differences** (marked with 'i'):
- Branch targets slightly different due to code reordering
- Jump table references using symbolic names vs hardcoded addresses

**Insertions/Deletions** (marked with '|' and '<'):
- Some NOPs and load instructions in different positions
- Three deleted instructions at lines 0x60, 0x64, 0x68

### Key Observation
The optimization `i = work->f24AC` (found at iteration 26 of local permuter) is correctly applied and helps with register allocation, but there are still subtle differences in:
1. Register allocation for return values
2. Delay slot instruction placement
3. Jump table address resolution

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Successfully tested decomp.me with Playwright automation
2. ‚úÖ Achieved 86% matching (score 825)
3. ‚úÖ Tested context configurations in decomp.me
4. ‚è≥ Join PS1 Decompilation Discord for expert advice

### Context Testing Results
**Discovery**: The decomp.me "Context" tab is for adding custom header/typedef code, not for selecting preset configurations.

**Testing Performed**:
- Empty context (default): Score 825 (86.02%)
- No pre-configured context dropdown found in MGS overlay preset
- Context field accepts custom C header code only

**Conclusion**: The MGS overlay preset does not include selectable context templates. To improve beyond 86%, would need to:
1. Manually add specific MGS header files
2. Research exact struct/typedef definitions from MGS source
3. Consult Discord community for header recommendations

### Complete OpenWork Struct Testing
**Discovery**: FoxdieTeam/mgs_reversing has complete OpenWork struct definition but function still unmatched.

**Testing Performed**:
1. Cloned FoxdieTeam repository to verify function status
2. Found function at `/tmp/foxdie_mgs/source/overlays/title/onoda/open/open.c:1263`
3. Confirmed function uses `#pragma INCLUDE_ASM` - **NOT YET DECOMPILED**
4. Extracted complete 137-line OpenWork struct with all field definitions
5. Created test version with char arrays for complex types (POLY_FT4, POLY_GT4, KCB)
6. Tested with both -G0 and -G8 compiler flags

**Results**:
| Struct Type | Compiler Flag | Score | Percentage |
|-------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| Simplified (padding) | -G8 | 825 | 86.02% ‚úÖ **BEST** |
| Complete (FoxdieTeam) | -G0 | 840 | 85.76% |
| Complete (FoxdieTeam) | -G8 | 840 | 85.76% |

**Critical Finding**:
- Complete struct **did NOT improve** the score
- Complete struct is actually **15 points worse** (840 vs 825)
- Compiler flag (-G0 vs -G8) made **NO difference** with complete struct
- Simplified padding-based struct remains the **optimal approach**

**Analysis**:
The complete struct causes different offset calculations that don't match the target assembly:
- Target uses offsets: 0x24bc, 0x24b4, 0x24ec, 0x24ac
- Complete struct generates: 0x19e4, 0x19dc, 0x1a14, 0x19d4
- Register allocation differences (v1 vs s0)
- Extra instructions generated that don't match target

**Conclusion**:
For this function, the compiler doesn't need to know about all intermediate struct fields. The simplified struct with only accessed fields (`f24AC`, `f24B4`, `f24BC`, `f24EC`) using char padding produces better assembly matching. This suggests the original compilation may have used a similar minimal struct definition or forward declaration.

## üî¨ Phase 3: Systematic Code Variations Testing (Track 2A-B)

**Date**: 2025-10-19 (continuation session)
**Starting Point**: 510 @ 91.36% (Phase 1+2 optimized version)
**Goal**: Test systematic C code variations to reach 100% match

### Testing Methodology

Following FINAL_ATTACK_PLAN.md Track 2A-B strategy, tested 4 systematic variations:
- **Track 2A**: Return statement patterns (VAR1, VAR2, VAR3)
- **Track 2B**: Switch statement patterns (VAR4)

All tests performed with:
- Compiler: PSYQ 4.4 (gcc 2.8.1 + aspsx 2.79)
- Flags: `-O2 -Wall -G8`
- Platform: decomp.me automated testing via Playwright MCP

### Variation Results

| # | Variation | Description | Score | Percentage | Change | Status |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|--------|--------|
| VAR1 | Explicit return temporary | Added `OpenWork *ret` variable, `ret = work->f24B4; return ret;` | 510 | 91.36% | NO CHANGE | ‚ùå |
| VAR2 | Inline conditional | Changed to single-line `if (work->f24BC != 0) return work->f24B4;` | 510 | 91.36% | NO CHANGE | ‚ùå |
| VAR3 | Const qualifier | Added `const int f24BC = work->f24BC;` cache with scope block | 510 | 91.36% | NO CHANGE | ‚ùå |
| VAR4 | Explicit switch variable | Added `int switchVal = work->f24AC; switch (switchVal)` | 510 | 91.36% | NO CHANGE | ‚ùå |

### Analysis of Results

**Key Finding**: None of the 4 systematic variations produced any improvement. All remained at 510 @ 91.36%.

**Implications**:
1. ‚ùå **Return statement patterns** are NOT the issue (VAR1, VAR2, VAR3 all failed)
2. ‚ùå **Switch variable declaration** is NOT the issue (VAR4 failed)
3. ‚úÖ **The problem is more fundamental** - likely related to:
   - PSYQ-specific register allocation patterns
   - Calling convention subtleties
   - Compiler optimization quirks specific to gcc 2.8.1

### Remaining Differences (Unchanged)

**Critical Assembly Differences** (from decomp.me diff at 510 @ 91.36%):

1. **Line 0x48 - Register Allocation Mystery**:
   - **Target**: `lw a0, 0x24b4(s1)` ‚Üê Uses `a0` for return value!
   - **Current**: `lw v0, 0x24b4(s1)` ‚Üê Standard `v0` return register
   - **Why**: Unknown - `a0` is typically argument register, not return value
   - **Impact**: This is the PRIMARY blocking issue

2. **Line 0x60 - Extra Instruction**:
   - **Target**: (no instruction)
   - **Current**: `move v0, s1`
   - **Why**: Unknown - possibly related to register allocation or delay slot
   - **Impact**: Secondary issue, likely cascading from Line 0x48

3. **Lines 0x70, 0x74, 0x78, 0x98, 0xb4 - Jump Table Differences**:
   - Minor branch target address differences
   - Symbolic vs hardcoded jump table addresses
   - **Why**: Code layout differences from above issues
   - **Impact**: Tertiary cascading effects

### Code Variation Files Created

All test variations saved in `/tmp/` for reference:
- `/tmp/variation1_explicit_return.c` - VAR1 test
- `/tmp/variation2_inline_conditionals.c` - VAR2 test
- `/tmp/variation3_const_qualifier.c` - VAR3 test
- `/tmp/variation4_explicit_switch_var.c` - VAR4 test
- `/tmp/phase1_optimized.c` - Baseline (510 @ 91.36%)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Traditional C Variations Have Limits**: Standard C pattern changes (return styles, variable declarations) don't affect PSYQ gcc 2.8.1 register allocation in this context

2. **Register Allocation is Compiler-Specific**: The `a0` vs `v0` difference suggests PSYQ has specific optimization patterns not easily controlled via C code

3. **Systematic Testing is Valuable**: Even negative results provide information - we can rule out entire categories of solutions

4. **Expert Input Needed**: After 4 systematic attempts with no improvement, community expertise is the logical next step

### Next Steps (Track 3A - Community Engagement)

**Status**: Ready for community help request
**Prepared**: Discord post in `DISCORD_POST.md` with:
- Comprehensive problem description
- All context (compiler, flags, progress)
- Specific technical questions about register allocation
- Link to decomp.me scratch for easy collaboration

**Probability of Success with Community**: ~50% (per FINAL_ATTACK_PLAN.md Track 3A estimate)

**Alternative Tracks** (if community doesn't resolve):
- Track 2B-VAR5: Test reordered case statements (unlikely to help based on VAR4 results)
- Track 2C: Variable declaration order variations (low probability)
- Track 4: Advanced techniques (assembly-level analysis, compiler flag experiments)

---

## üß™ Phase 4: Concrete Experiments - Register Allocation Testing

**Date**: 2025-10-19 (continued session)
**Starting Point**: 510 @ 91.36% (Phase 1+2 optimized baseline)
**Goal**: Force PSYQ gcc 2.8.1 to use `a0` register instead of `v0` at line 0x48

### Experiment Design

Following user's strategic plan (point 2), tested two concrete approaches to force `a0` register allocation:

**EXPERIMENT A**: Direct register binding with inline assembly
- Approach: Use GCC's `register` variable with `__asm__("$4")` constraint
- Rationale: Explicitly bind return value to `a0` register ($4 in MIPS)
- Pattern: `register OpenWork *tmp __asm__("$4") = work->f24B4;`

**EXPERIMENT B**: Tail-call sink function with assembly barrier
- Approach: Inline function with volatile asm to force register load
- Rationale: Create fake "tail call" pattern that might influence register allocation
- Pattern: `psx_sink(work->f24B4); return work->f24B4;`

### Results Summary

| Experiment | Score | Percentage | Change from Baseline | Status |
|------------|-------|------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Baseline** (Phase 1+2) | 510 | 91.36% | - | ‚úÖ Best |
| **Experiment A** (register binding) | 705 | 88.05% | **-3.31%** WORSE | ‚ùå Failed |
| **Experiment B** (tail sink) | 510 | 91.36% | **NO CHANGE** | ‚ùå Failed |

### Detailed Analysis

#### EXPERIMENT A: Register Binding Results (705 @ 88.05%)

**Code Pattern**:
```c
#ifdef __GNUC__
  if (work->f24BC != 0)
  {
    register OpenWork *tmp __asm__("$4") = work->f24B4;  // $4 = a0
    __asm__ volatile ("" : : "r"(tmp));  // Barrier to prevent elimination
    return tmp;
  }
#endif
```

**Assembly Impact**:
- ‚úÖ **Line 0x48**: Successfully achieved `lw a0,0x24b4(s1)` - **MATCHES TARGET!**
- ‚ùå **Line 0x50**: Introduced NEW extra instruction `move v0,a0` (not in target)
- ‚ùå **Line 0x60**: Still has extra `move v0,s1` (unchanged from baseline)
- ‚ùå **Overall score**: WORSE - solved one problem but created another

**Analysis**: The register constraint worked TOO well - it forced `a0` allocation but then required an extra move to convert `a0` ‚Üí `v0` for the return value, making the code worse overall.

#### EXPERIMENT B: Tail Sink Results (510 @ 91.36%)

**Code Pattern**:
```c
static inline void psx_sink(OpenWork *p)
{
  __asm__ volatile ("" : : "r"(p));
}

if (work->f24BC != 0)
{
  psx_sink(work->f24B4);  // Force load into register before return
  return work->f24B4;
}
```

**Assembly Impact**:
- ‚ùå **Line 0x48**: Still uses `lw v0,0x24b4(s1)` - NO CHANGE
- ‚ùå **No improvement**: PSYQ completely optimized away the sink function
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Score identical**: 510 @ 91.36% - exactly same as baseline

**Analysis**: The inline barrier function had ZERO effect on register allocation. PSYQ's optimizer removed it entirely, treating the code identically to the baseline.

### Key Findings

1. **Register Constraints Don't Help**: Explicitly forcing `a0` creates cascading problems
2. **Compiler Optimizations Win**: Barrier functions are optimized away by PSYQ
3. **Trade-off Problem**: Solving line 0x48 alone isn't enough - need holistic solution
4. **PSYQ-Specific Behavior**: The `a0` usage in target is likely from specific compilation context we can't replicate

### Probability Assessment Update

**Original Estimate** (point 2 in user's plan): ~30% probability
**Actual Result**: 0% success - both experiments failed

**Revised Probabilities** for remaining tracks:
- **Track 3** (Toolchain alignment): ~20% (was worth trying experiments first)
- **Track 4** (Dev integration): ~95% (pragmatic fallback, always works)
- **Track 5** (Accept 510): 100% (guaranteed solution)

### Screenshots Evidence

decomp.me testing performed with Playwright MCP automation:
- **Experiment A**: Score 705 @ 88.05%
- **Experiment B**: Score 510 @ 91.36%
- Both tests used compiler: PSYQ 4.4 (gcc 2.8.1 + aspsx 2.79), flags: `-O2 -Wall -G8`

### Lessons Learned

1. **C Code Has Limits**: Some compiler behaviors can't be controlled via C patterns
2. **PSYQ-Specific**: The `a0` anomaly appears to be compiler-internal optimization decision
3. **Holistic Matching Required**: Individual line fixes don't help if they create other problems
4. **Experiments Valuable**: Even failures provide information - ruled out entire approach category

### Next Steps - Strategic Decision Point

**STATUS**: Both concrete experiments (point 2) completed and failed.

**Recommended Path Forward** (per user's strategic plan):

**Option A - Track 3**: Toolchain Alignment (20% probability)
- Investigate differences between decomp.me and local permuter
- Check compiler versions, flags, library paths
- Unlikely to resolve given experiments failed on decomp.me itself

**Option B - Track 4**: Dev Integration (95% probability, pragmatic)
- Integrate current best C code (510 @ 91.36%) into `dev_exe` build
- Use `#ifdef NON_MATCHING` guard around function
- Include explanation of blocking issue in comments
- Allows project to progress while keeping this function matchable later

**Option C - Track 5**: Accept Current State (100% probability)
- Accept 510 @ 91.36% as "good enough"
- Document findings thoroughly
- Focus effort on other functions with higher match probability
- **User's original guidance**: "Se dopo 1-2 giorni non c'√® breakthrough, accetta 1655 locale e procedi"

### Recommendation

Given both experiments failed and probability of further C-code-based improvements is near zero, recommend **Option B (Track 4: Dev Integration)**:

1. Integrate Phase 1+2 optimized code (510 @ 91.36%) into dev build with `#ifdef NON_MATCHING`
2. Document blocking issue (PSYQ register allocation anomaly at line 0x48)
3. Mark function as "nearly matched, compiler quirk remaining"
4. This allows MGS reversing project to use our improved decompilation
5. Leaves door open for future breakthroughs (community insights, better tools)
