# title_open_800CE378 - Permuter Exploration Progress

## Status: IN PROGRESS âœ“

**Start Time**: 2025-10-19 20:57
**Base C Code Score**: 9865 (from manual decomp 730 on decomp.me)
**Current Best Score**: 6695 (iteration 250)
**Improvement**: 3170 points (~32% reduction)

## Score History

| Iteration | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| 0 | 9865 | Base |
| 43 | 7960 | Major improvement |
| 247 | 7165 | Continued improvement |
| 250 | **6695** | **Current Best** |

## Discovered Optimizations So Far

The permuter has been testing variations of:
1. Pointer calculation methods
2. Temporary variable patterns
3. Struct field access ordering
4. Case statement optimization
5. Register allocation hints

## Next Steps

- Let permuter continue running (--stop-on-zero will stop at 0)
- Monitor for convergence to optimal solution
- Extract best variation when completed
- Manual review of winning patterns
- Consider additional permuter iterations if needed

## Expected Outcomes

If permuter reaches score 0, that means 100% match with target assembly.
Current trajectory suggests significant further improvements possible.
