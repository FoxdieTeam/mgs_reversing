SCORE: 730 @ 90.39% match

This version achieved the best score so far by:
1. Using explicit base pointer calculation: (char *)work + 0x18C
2. Using array indexing: &base[index] to let compiler optimize register allocation
3. 40-byte RGBElement struct with 33-byte padding
4. State machine with 5 cases (0-4)

Key discoveries:
- State machine for RGB fade effects
- Each RGBElement is 40 bytes (not 7 as initially thought)
- Assembly uses: sll v0,a1,0x2 + addu v0,v0,a1 + sll v0,v0,0x3 = (index * 5) * 8 = index * 40
- State variable at work + 0xA8C
- Counter at work + 0x178
- RGB pointer base at work + 0x18C

NEXT STEPS TO REACH 100%:
1. The remaining ~9.61% gap suggests:
   - Register allocation differences (a2 vs a1 for elem pointer)
   - Different pointer calculation sequence
   - Control flow optimization (j vs jr ra)
   - Extra nop in delay slot optimization

VARIATIONS TO TRY:
1. Combine pointer calculation differently: (RGBElement *)((char *)work + 0x18C) + index
2. Use different temporary variable patterns
3. Try moving pointer calc inside/outside switch
4. Experiment with volatile keyword
5. Try different case ordering or structure
6. Consider using inline asm hints for register placement
